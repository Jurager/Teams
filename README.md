## Introduction

Teams is Laravel package using Jetstream's based teams to manage team functionality and operate with user permissions and abilities.

## Installation
    composer require jurager/teams

Note, running command below can overwrite your directories and files, please make backup before.

After successfully installing the package from composer, run `php artisan teams:install` to publish configuration and package files.

If you also want to publish package's `App\Models` directory with Team and User model, pass the `--models` option to command above.

After publishing all package's data, put the `App\Providers\TeamsServiceProvider::class` to app.php config in providers section.

### [#](#actions) Actions

Team creation and deletion logic may be customized by modifying the relevant action classes within your `app/Actions/Teams` directory. These actions include `CreateTeam`, `UpdateTeamName`, and `DeleteTeam`. Each of these actions is invoked when their corresponding task is performed by the user in the application's UI. You are free to modify these actions as required based on your application's needs.

[#](#inspecting-user-teams) Inspecting User Teams
-------------------------------------------------

Information about a user's teams may be accessed via the methods provided by the `Jurager\Teams\Traits\HasTeams` trait. This trait is automatically applied to your application's `App\Models\User` model during installation. This trait provides a variety of helpful methods that allow you to inspect a user's teams:

    // Access a user's currently selected team...
    $user->currentTeam : \Jurager\Teams\Team
    
    // Access all of the team's (including owned teams) that a user belongs to...
    $user->teams : Illuminate\Support\Collection
    
    // Access all of a user's owned teams...
    $user->ownedTeams : Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Collection
    
    // Access all of the teams that a user belongs to but does not own...
    $user->belongedTeams : Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Collection

    // Determine if a user owns a given team...
    $user->ownsTeam($team) : bool
    
    // Determine if a user belongs to a given team...
    $user->belongsToTeam($team) : bool
    
    // Get the role that the user is assigned on the team...
    $user->teamRole($team) : \Jurager\Teams\Role
    
    // Determine if the user has the given role on the given team...
    $user->hasTeamRole($team, 'admin') : bool
    
    // Access an array of all permissions a user has for a given team...
    $user->teamPermissions($team) : array
    
    // Determine if a user has a given team permission...
    $user->hasTeamPermission($team, 'server:create') : bool

    // Determine if a user has a given ability on certain model...
    $user->hasTeamAbility($team, 'server:edit', \App\Models\Server $server) : bool

    // @todo:Refactor
    // Add an ability for user to action on certain model, if permission is not found, will create a new one
    $user->allowTeamAbility( (string|array) 'server:edit', (\App\Models\Server) $server, (Model) $team ) : bool

    // @todo:Refactor
    // Forbid an ability for user to action on certain model, used in case if  global permission or role allowing this action
    $user->forbidTeamAbility( (string|array) 'server:edit', (\App\Models\Server) $server, (Model) $team ) : bool


### [#](#the-current-team) The Current Team

Every user within a application has a "current team". This is the team that the user is actively viewing resources for. For example, if you are building a calendar application, your application would display the upcoming calendar events for the user's current team.

You may access the user's current team using the `$user->currentTeam` Eloquent relationship. This relationship may be used to scope your other Eloquent queries by the user's current team:

    use App\Models\Calendar;
    
    return Calendar::where(
        'team_id', $request->user()->currentTeam->id
    )->get();

### [#](#the-team-object) The Team Object

The team object that is accessed via `$user->currentTeam` or other team-related Eloquent queries provides a variety of useful methods for inspecting the team's attributes and relationships:

    // Access the team's owner...
    $team->owner : App\Models\User
    
    // Get all of the team's users, including the owner...
    $team->allUsers() : Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Collection
    
    // Get all of the team's users, excluding the owner...
    $team->users : Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Collection
    
    // Determine if the given user is a team member...
    $team->hasUser($user) : bool
    
    // Determine if the team has a member with the given email address...
    $team->hasUserWithEmail($emailAddress) : bool
    
    // Determine if the given user is a team member with the given permission...
    $team->userHasPermission($user, $permission) : bool

    // Remove the given user from the team.
    $team->removeUser( (Model) $user) : void

    // Get all of the pending user invitations for the team.
    $team->invitations() : Eloquent\Relations\HasMany


[#](#member-management) Member Management
-----------------------------------------

By default, only team owners can manage team membership. This restriction is defined in the `App\Policies\TeamPolicy` class. Naturally, you are free to modify this policy as you see fit.

### [#](#member-management-actions) Member Management Actions

Like the customization process for other package features, team member addition logic may be customized by modifying the `App\Actions\Teams\AddTeamMember` action class. The class' `add` method is invoked with the currently authenticated user, the `Jurager\Teams\Team` instance, the email address of the user being added to the team, and the role (if applicable) of the user being added to the team.

This action is responsible for validating that the user can actually be added to the team and then adding the user to the team. You are free to customize this action based on the needs of your particular application.

Team member removal may be customized by modifying the `App\Actions\Teams\RemoveTeamMember` action class.


### [#](#invitations) Invitations

By default, package will simply add any existing application user that you specify to your team. However, many applications choose to send invitation emails to users that are invited to teams. If the user does not have an account, the invitation email can instruct them to create an account and accept the invitation. Or, if the user already has an account, they can accept or ignore the invitation.

Thankfully, package allows you to enable team member invitations for your application with just a few lines of code. To get started, pass the `invitations` option to configuration. This may be done by modifying the `features` array of your application's `config/teams.php` configuration file:

    use Jurager\Teams\Features;
    
    'features' => [
        Features::api(),
        Features::accountInvitation(),
        Features::accountDeletion(),
    ],


Once you have enabled invitations feature, users that are invited to teams will receive an invitation email with a link to accept the team invitation. Users will not be full members of the team until the invitation is accepted.

#### [#](#invitation-actions) Invitation Actions

When a user is invited to the team, your application's `App\Actions\Teams\InviteTeamMember` action will be invoked with the currently authenticated user, the team that the new user is invited to, the email address of the invited user, and, optionally, the role that should be assigned to the user once they join the team. You are free to review this action or modify it based on the needs of your own application.

Laravel Mail

Before using the team invitation feature, you should ensure that your Laravel application is configured to [send emails](https://laravel.com/docs/mail) . Otherwise, Laravel will be unable to send team invitation emails to your application's users.

[#](#roles-permissions) Roles / Permissions
-------------------------------------------

Each team member added to a team may be assigned a given role, and each role is assigned a set of permissions. Role permissions are defined in your application's `App\Providers\TeamsServiceProvider` class using the `Teams::role` method. This method accepts a "slug" for the role, a user-friendly role name, the role permissions, and a description of the role. This information will be used to display the role within the team member management view.

For example, imagine we are building a server management application such as [Laravel Forge](https://forge.laravel.com) . We might define our application's team roles like so:

    Teams::defaultApiTokenPermissions(['read']);
    
    Teams::role('admin', 'Administrator', [
        'server:create',
        'server:read',
        'server:update',
        'server:delete',
    ])->description('Administrator users can perform any action.');
    
    Teams::role('support', 'Support Specialist', [
        'server:read',
    ])->description('Support specialists can read server information.');


Team API Support

Available API permissions are automatically derived by combining all unique permissions available to roles. Therefore, a separate call to the `Teams::permissions` method is unnecessary.

### [#](#authorization) Authorization

Of course, you will need a way to authorize that incoming requests initiated by a team member may actually be performed by that user. A user's team permissions may be inspected using the `hasTeamPermission` method available via the `Jurager\Teams\Traits\HasTeams` trait.

**There is typically not a need to inspect a user's role. You only need to inspect that the user has a given granular permission.** Roles are simply a presentational concept used to group granular permissions. Typically, you will execute calls to this method within your application's [authorization policies](https://laravel.com/docs/authorization) :

    return $user->hasTeamPermission($server->team, 'server:update');

[#](#abilities) Abilities
-------------------------------------------

Adding abilities to users is made easy. You do not have to create a role or an ability in advance. Simply pass the name of the ability, and package will create it if it doesn't exist.

Let's give the ability to edit an article in team for certain user, we need to pass the entity, at this example - article object, an team object

    User::allowTeamAbility('edit', $article, $team))

For example, to check this ability in feature, use:
    
    User::hasTeamAbility('edit', $article, $team);

To forbid user from some ability (in case if role abilities is allowing this ability)

    User::forbidTeamAbility('edit', $article, $team);

To create abilities without attaching it to user, use the Ability model which is published during install
    
    Ability::firstOrCreate([ 'name' => 'edit', 'title' => 'Edit' ]);
 

[#](#middlewares) Middlewares
-----------------------------------------

### [#](#middlewares-configuration) Configuration

The middleware is registered automatically as `role`, `permission`, `ability`.
If you want to change or customize them, go to your `config/teams.php` and set the `middleware.register` value to `false` and add the following to the `routeMiddleware` array in `app/Http/Kernel.php`:

    'role'       => \Jurager\Teams\Middleware\Role::class, 
    'permission' => \Jurager\Teams\Middleware\Permission::class,
    'ability'    => \Jurager\Teams\Middleware\Ability::class,

### [#](#middlewares-routes) Routes

You can use a middleware to filter routes and route groups by permission or role:

    Route::group(['prefix' => 'admin', 'middleware' => ['role:admin,#team_id#']], function() {
        Route::get('/', 'CommonController@commonIndex');
        Route::get('/users', ['middleware' => ['permission:views-users,#team_id#'], 'uses' => 'CommonController@commonUsers']);
    });

Where `#team_id#` is your actual ID of the team in database. 

If you want to change or customize the name of this variable, go to your `config/teams.php` and set the `foreign_keys.team_id` value to follow your database structure.

Note, that middleware logic may be varied on how you pass the `team_id` variable:

You can pass the `team_id` variable as route param:
 
    Route::get('/{team_id}/users', ['middleware' => ['permission:views-users'], 'uses' => 'CommonController@commonUsers']);

You can pass the `team_id` variable directly as middleware option
    
     'middleware' => ['role:admin|root,#team_id#']

You can pass the `team_id` variable with each GET/POST/PUT or other type requests.

### [#](#middlewares-usage) Usage

If you want to use OR operation use the pipe symbol:

    'middleware' => ['role:admin|root,{team_id}']
    // $user->hasTeamRole($team, ['admin', 'root']);

    'middleware' => ['permission:edit-post|edit-user']
    // $user->hasTeamPermission($team, ['edit-post', 'edit-user']);

If you want to use AND functionality you can do:

    'middleware' => ['role:admin|root,{team_id},require']
    // $user->hasTeamRole($team, ['admin', 'root'], '{team_id}', true);
    
    'middleware' => ['permission:edit-post|edit-user,{team_id},require']
    // $user->hasTeamPermission($team, ['edit-post', 'edit-user'], '{team_id}', true);

To check the `ability` to action on certain model item you can use `ability` middleware:
    
    'middleware' => ['ability:edit,App\Models\Article,atricle_id']
    // $user->hasTeamAbility($team, 'edit', $article);

In this case you need to pass `atricle_id` as `request param` or `route param` to allow package identify model object
